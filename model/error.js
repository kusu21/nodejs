// Why I have added name property which is same as name of object?
// Answer: This is to avoid programming errors, because if we don't have
// name property we have to write 'VAL_ERR_...' as this is treated as string
// By JS it will not throw error and there is possibility to make typo there
// but now we have to write errList.VAL_ERR_.. this is JS variable name
// and JS will throw error when we make typo there.

//
// NOTE:
// - Error code must be unique for all error objects.
// - Internal error is used for debugging purpose hence don't send it to client.
